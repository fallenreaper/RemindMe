# RemindMe
The purpose of this application is to create a RemindMe system for Twitter.  There exists a similar functionality on Reddit which I feel would be very beneficial to run through Twitter to remind users of tweets they want to revisit

Part One, Defining a Database.
	The Key information for this application is pretty much 1 table, It contains the following:
	TweetLink, TweetContent, UserId, PostDate, RemindDate

Part Two, Define a System for Reading Feeds.
	#RemindMe would be likely as it is making use of Twitters key idea.
	!RemindMe is the Reddit variant.
	@_Remind_Me is the Twitter Account.
	I believe that any 3 of these should be valid wants to implement RemindMe functionality.

Part Three, Leverage Database monitoring to cut down on querying

Part Four, Respond To Tweets.
